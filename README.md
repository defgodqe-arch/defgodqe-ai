## Demo

This template demonstrates how to build an AI-powered chat interface using Cloudflare Workers AI with streaming responses. It features:

- Real-time streaming of AI responses using Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Easy customization of models and system prompts
- Support for AI Gateway integration
- Clean, responsive UI that works on mobile and desktop

## Features

- 💬 Simple and responsive chat interface
- ⚡ Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming responses
- 🧠 Powered by Cloudflare Workers AI LLMs
- 🛠️ Built with TypeScript and Cloudflare Workers
- 📱 Mobile-friendly design
- 🔄 Maintains chat history on the client
- 🔎 Built-in Observability logging

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer)
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/)
- A Cloudflare account with Workers AI access

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cloudflare/templates.git
   cd templates/llm-chat-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Generate Worker type definitions:
   ```bash
   npm run cf-typegen
   ```

### Development

Start a local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local server at http://localhost:8787.

Note: Using Workers AI accesses your Cloudflare account even during local development, which will incur usage charges.

### Deployment

Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Monitor

View real-time logs associated with any deployed Worker:

```bash
npm wrangler tail
```

## How It Works

### Backend

The backend is built with Cloudflare Workers and uses the Workers AI platform to generate responses. The main components are:

1. **API Endpoint** (`/api/chat`): Accepts POST requests with chat messages and streams responses
2. **Streaming**: Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time streaming of AI responses
3. **Workers AI Binding**: Connects to Cloudflare's AI service via the Workers AI binding

### Frontend

The frontend is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript application that:

1. Presents a chat interface
2. Sends user messages to the API
3. Processes streaming responses in real-time
4. Maintains chat history on the client side

## Customization

### Changing the Model

To use a different AI model, update the `MODEL_ID` constant in `src/index.ts`. You can find available models in the [Cloudflare Workers AI documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/).

### Using AI Gateway

The template includes commented code for AI Gateway integration, which provides additional capabilities like rate limiting, caching, and analytics.

To enable AI Gateway:

1. [Create an AI Gateway](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ai/ai-gateway) in your Cloudflare dashboard
2. Uncomment the gateway configuration in `src/index.ts`
3. Replace `YOUR_GATEWAY_ID` with your actual AI Gateway ID
4. Configure other gateway options as needed:
   - `skipCache`: Set to `true` to bypass gateway caching
   - `cacheTtl`: Set the cache time-to-live in seconds

Learn more about [AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/).

### Modifying the System Prompt

The default system prompt can be changed by updating the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` constant in `src/index.ts`.

### Styling

The UI styling is contained in the `<style>` section of `public/index.html`. You can modify the CSS variables at the top to quickly change the color scheme.

## Hugging Face model for defchat AI

The native AI panel in defchat can use Hugging Face Inference Providers with **Qwen/Qwen3-4B** (multilingual, including English and Spanish). It uses the provider router's `:fastest` policy and automatically falls back to Cloudflare Workers AI if Hugging Face is not configured or temporarily fails. The browser never receives the Hugging Face token.

To enable it on the deployed Worker:

1. Create a Hugging Face access token with permission to use Inference Providers at [Hugging Face Settings → Access Tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).
2. In the Cloudflare dashboard, open the **defgodqe AI** Worker at `ai.defgodqe.workers.dev`.
3. Open **Settings → Variables and Secrets → Add** and add `HF_TOKEN` as an encrypted **Secret**. Never put this token in frontend code, GitHub files, or a `VITE_*` variable.
4. Optionally add `HF_MODEL` as a regular variable to override the default `Qwen/Qwen3-4B:fastest` model.
5. Redeploy/restart the Worker if the dashboard prompts you to.

The AI panel supports **Auto**, **English**, and **Español** voice language settings. English replies use the configured server TTS when available. Spanish replies use a Spanish voice installed in the user's browser/device, because the current server TTS model is English-only. For a consistent premium Spanish voice on every device, deploy a multilingual TTS model behind a server-side endpoint and keep any credentials in Worker secrets.
